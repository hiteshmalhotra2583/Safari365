    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

Thank you for your enquiry. This is an automated reply to acknowledge we have received your request and a dedicated travel specialist will revert to you within 24 hours*

By way of introduction, Safari 365 is a leading tour operator specialising ONLY in Africa. Our organisation has been operating since 2006 and have 2000 happy clients travel with us annually. We are bonded with SATSA and have the right affiliations and credibility in place to ensure your peace of mind.

As African travel specialists, we only sell the products and services that we know and trust and have experienced first-hand. We do not sell ‘off-the-shelf’ travel, we prefer to work with you to tailor make your vacation to ensure you get a safe, great value and once in a lifetime experience! Read our review section here for previous client feedback.

Due to the volume of business we generate and because you are dealing directly with us, we cut out the middleman and offer you exceptionally competitive rates (we are regularly 5-15% cheaper than dealing with the hotel or lodge directly).
