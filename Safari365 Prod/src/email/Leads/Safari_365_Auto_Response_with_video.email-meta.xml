By way of introduction, Safari 365 is a leading tour operator specialising ONLY in Africa. Our organisation has been operating since 2004 and have over 1500 happy clients travel with us annually. We are bonded with SATSA and have the right affiliations and credibility in place to ensure your peace of mind.

As African travel specialists, we only sell the products and services that we know and trust and have experienced first-hand. We tailor-make your vacation to ensure you enjoy a safe and memorable experience. Read our review section here for previous client feedback.

Due to the volume of business we generate and because you are dealing directly with us, we cut out the middleman and offer you exceptionally competitive rates (we are regularly 5-15% cheaper than dealing with the hotel or lodge directly).
