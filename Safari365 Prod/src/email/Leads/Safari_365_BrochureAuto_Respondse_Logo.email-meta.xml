As one of Africaâ€™s leading travel companies, we strive to share our passion and inspire journeys to this fabulous continent. Should you want additional complimentary country travel guides, please click here for the full list

Our organisation has been operating since 2006 and has 2000 clients travel with us annually. We are bonded with SATSA and have the right affiliations and credibility in place to ensure your peace of mind. We specialise ONLY in African travel, and recommend to our clients the lodges and services that we trust and have experienced first-hand. Read our review section here for previous client feedback.


Due to the volume of business we generate and because you are dealing directly with us, we can offer you exceptionally competitive rates (we are regularly 5-15% cheaper than dealing with the hotel or lodge directly).

A travel consultant will make contact with you to see whether we can assist you in any way; if you would like contact us in the interim, please email info@safari365.com or call any of our international numbers below:
