    <subject>{!User.Division} - {!Account.Name} : Your Booking with Safari 365</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.Name},
Thank you for the opportunity you have afforded Safari 365 thus far on quoting on your holiday requirements. I have discussed your booking in full with {!Account.OwnerFullName} and overseen your file progress from original contact.

I realise that you are potentially at a crossroads in your decision making, and assure you that we remain committed to obtaining your business and providing you with top class travel services.

We are an African-based operator specialising in selling ONLY Africa. As our track record shows, over 1500 happy clients travel with us annually due to the superior rates and service they receive. We have been in the game long enough to have developed a thorough understanding of how our clients can get the best from their holiday experience, and have the facilities in place to manage your vacation when you are actually travelling in Africa. .

We carefully select all of our suppliers to ensure that you get exactly the best value your money can buy. Our consortium business is the 2nd biggest purchaser of bed nights in Southern Africa; and as we are an online company, we cut out the middleman and pass these discounts directly on to you (Note: when comparing apples with apples, we should be significantly cheaper than other alternatives.) On top of that, we have the right affiliations and credibility in place to ensure your peace of mind.

Should we be up against another operator due to a price discrepancy, please forward us their quotation for a fair chance to quote against it. We are confident that on  a like-for-like basis we can compete against any quotation.


We pride ourselves on taking the time to hear what our clients have to say – it’s how we ensure that our service is always up to scratch. Any concerns you may have can be addressed directly with me, and I will endeavour to put them to rest.

We look forward to making this trip a reality for you.

Kind regards,
