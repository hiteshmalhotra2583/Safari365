    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},
Hello again from Cape Town. I’m just following up to ensure that you successfully received my earlier email regarding your vacation to Africa.

Africa is a destination in high demand, and the best locations at the optimum times of year are booked far in advance. In order to live up to our ‘best in the business’ reputation I am eager to start assisting you as soon as possible as no accommodation has yet been reserved.

If you are no longer interested in travelling to Africa, please advise and I will close your file.  Should you still want to travel, please let me know so that we can start making this trip a reality.

Kind regards,
