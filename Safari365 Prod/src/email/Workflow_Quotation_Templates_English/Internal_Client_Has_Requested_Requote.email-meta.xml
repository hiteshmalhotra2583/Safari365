    <textOnly>Dear {!Quotations__c.Consultant_Name__c},

Your client has requested a requote as the original quote has surpassed its validity date.

Client: {!Quotations__c.Primary_Client_Name__c}
Opportunity: {!Quotations__c.Opportunity__c}
Quote: {!Quotations__c.Quotation_Name__c}

To Do:

Create a new itinerary document by clicking the button in the quote (this will extend the validity date for an additional 7 days and recheck the exchange rate to be used).

Delete the old PDF Itinerary document in the Client Facing Folder, and save the new one in its place.

Send the client an email alerting them their new itinerary is available to confirm.</textOnly>
