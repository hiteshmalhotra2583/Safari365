    <textOnly>Even More Than World-Class Safaris


Dear [fname],

There is a reason we have been tailor-making trips to Tanzania for over 10 years now. Simply put, it is a premier safari destination in Africa sure to leave travelers with unforgettable memories.

A journey through the Serengeti or experiencing the Great Migration first hand are more than likely near the top of many bucket-lists across the globe. Tanzania has everything a safari-goer could wish for: abundant wildlife, stunning landscapes, luxury lodges and expert wildlife guides.

Excitingly, apart from the spectacular safaris, Tanzania has even more to offer travelers looking for new, memorable adventures. A getaway to Tanzania gives travelers the opportunity to experience many facets to the country including rich culture and deep history. This month we take a look at everything Tanzania has to offer.

Another fantastic feature is that just off the coast of mainland Tanzania is Zanzibar – the perfect destination for winding-down after a thrilling safari adventure.

Yours in Safari,
