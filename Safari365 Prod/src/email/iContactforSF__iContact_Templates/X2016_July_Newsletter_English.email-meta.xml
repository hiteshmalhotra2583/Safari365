Dear [fname],

It’s been a busy few months here at Safari365. We’ve rebranded, resdesigned and launched our new website, hoping to inspire and excite your sense of travel.

Our efforts deserved some reward, and so we packed our bags for an inspection of Botswana’s best kept secrets. Over 60 lodges were visited in two weeks – we covered the Okavango Delta, Savuti, Linyanti and Moremi. We’re excited to share what we’ve discovered.

Next month sees our 10-year anniversary and in the spirit of celebration, we’ll be launching an exciting opportunity, so watch this space.

Until then, be inspired and safe travels!


~ Marcus Brain, Safari365 founder
