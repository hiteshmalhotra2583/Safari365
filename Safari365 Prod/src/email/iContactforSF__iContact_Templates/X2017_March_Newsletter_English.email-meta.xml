    <textOnly>Harvest Season in Cape Town&apos;s Vineyard

Dear [fname],

It’s officially the beginning of autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and Cape Town is experiencing shorter days and cooler nights with the arrival of the new season.

Autumn also signals the end of harvest season in the award-winning Cape Winelands. Wine farms across the region are bustling with late harvest time activity.

This month, we feature the Constantia Winelands – South Africa’s oldest wine producing region.

The Constantia Winelands area is the whole package: history, scenic views, and highly esteemed wines. With the area being a short 20-minute journey from Cape Town’s City Center, the nine Constantia wine farms and estates are a hugely popular destination for visitors to the city year round.

In other travel related accolades, South Africa now boasts four lodges on National Geographic&apos;s esteemed &apos;Unique Lodges of the World&apos; list. Each lodge is deeply vetted for its authentic and responsible travel experiences before being added, see the full list here.

Yours in Safari,</textOnly>
