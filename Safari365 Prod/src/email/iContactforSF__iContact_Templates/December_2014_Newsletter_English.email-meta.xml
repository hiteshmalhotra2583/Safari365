Hello travelers

What  a year it’s been. From seeing Nigeria and Senegal defeat Ebola, to
new exciting experiences and lodges being created

in Cape Town, the Serengeti and beyond. Not to mention,

terrific photos captured by you, our guests.

We wish you a fruitful 2015 and joyful festive season.

Here’s to chasing the horizon.

- Marcus Brian, Safari365 founder

Experience Kruger

The festive season is upon us and with it, comes great memories. And
there’s no place we’d rather be than the Kruger National Park.

Kruger safaris tick all the boxes of a genuine African wildlife adventure
– from the mystery of [1]Timbavati, to [2]exceptionally unique lodges and
[3]private experie[4]nces with friends and family, as well as [5]kids –
you’ll find it.
