Dear [fname],


Inland deltas and lakes, unfenced national parks and endless salt pans – Botswana is a fairy tale African destination. This month we’ll be exploring Bots (as we in the safari trade affectionately call it) and everything it offers.


Having just traveled there myself, I cannot explain to you the excitement brimming in my heart. The photos, videos and words on our ever expanding blog filled with wanderlust wonders will tell you everything you need to know and more in the coming month.


And  as always, there will be a buffet of tours and vacations on offer.


In other news, African summer is on the way and high season is once again upon us. Considering the stories below – like our guest who ran into world famous Mick Fanning whilst on holiday – we&apos;re off to a great start.


See you in Africa soon.

REMEMBERING

NELSON MANDELA


In July we celebrated the life Nelson Mandela, a legend who is as much of an icon as Table Mountain, the Great Serengeti and the Big Five, if not bigger. The spirited father and leader will forever be engraved on the hearts of the people who loved him – from here to Timbuktu.


To commemorate Madiba and all he has done, we selected 10 quotes from the man who saved South Africa.
