    <subject>Happy Holidays from Safari365</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear [fname],

As we look back on a year filled with so many unexpected events, some challenging, some joyous, Africa has seen steadfast growth and positive development. We have seen some superb conservation efforts (featured below) together with positive government initiatives (especially in Tanzania and Botswana).

2016 saw Safari365 celebrate 10 years of operation, with over 1500 happy clients now travelling with us annually. In honor of this decade of service, we gave away a safari to the value of USD 10,000 - and we continue to share the best of Southern and East Africa with you.

As a company, we also took a large step in opening a USA based office to support our global presence and join our Brazil and Australia offices. Our head office is still firmly rooted in South Africa.

And as the year isn’t quite over yet, for any of our clients looking for an exceptionally short notice break to Cape Town, we have just had cancellations for rooms over Christmas and New Year. We are giving these away at amazingly discounted prices. See below and contact us if you’re inspired to see out 2016 in Cape Town!

To all of our clients and friends who have travelled with us in 2016, we want to say thank you!

What a year! Here’s to many more!


Our Lucky Winner!

Congratulations to Henriette Cronje, the luck winner of our USD10,000 safari giveaway. Henriette, have the best time ever and send us lots of pictures!
