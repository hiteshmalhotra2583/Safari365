Dear [fname],

It’s that time of the year again when we can look forward to much deserved time off, with family and friends.

Personally, I can’t think of a better time. As the founder of a leading safari operator based in Cape Town, I get to wake up every morning with the sun rising over Table Mountain. What could be better? Maybe a Kruger safari… but let me not digress.

If you are inspired to see Africa in 2016 and would like some assistance –browse our not to be missed tours below. And if you just need a bit of wanderlust inspiration, we have plenty of that – the guest photo of the month being a sure winner.

Safe travels!
