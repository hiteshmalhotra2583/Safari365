Hello {!Lead.FirstName},

I’m writing to you from our buzzing Cape Town offices, next to me are my packed bags. This month I&apos;ll be heading out to Tanzania. Joining me will be a specially selected group from our team. Together we’ll be exploring all the must-see sights, lodges and surrounds. We do this every year so we can provide you with priceless insight.

You can look forward to several exciting announcements


In the meantime have a peek at what we’ve been up to below. You’ll also find 2 Tanzania tours, hand-crafted by yours truly. I look forward to welcoming you to Africa soon.
