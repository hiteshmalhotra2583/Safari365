Dear [fname],

East Africa is celebrated as being home to the world’s greatest safari destinations namely Tanzania’s Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater, and Kenya’s Masai Mara.

It is now easier than ever to experience these destinations with our newly launched small group safaris.

With selected departure dates for both Tanzania and Kenya, our guests now have an opportunity to experience the highlights of these spectacular wildlife destinations, at a reduced cost.

Furthermore, certain departure dates are back to back to allow for an all-encompassing experience of both Kenya and Tanzania!

With a maximum of 6 guests per tour, 4 star graded accommodation throughout, as well as a dedicated safari guide, these itineraries promise a truly memorable experience.

Due to limited availability and popular demand, we suggest your book your place on one of our special small group safaris today!
