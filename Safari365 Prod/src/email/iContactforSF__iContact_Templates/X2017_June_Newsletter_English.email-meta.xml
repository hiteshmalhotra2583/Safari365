    <textOnly>Ngorongoro Crater: Tanzania&apos;s Natural Wonder

Dear [fname],

Tucked away on Tanzania’s Northern Safari Circuit is one of the most beautiful and abundant wildlife havens on the planet.

The Ngorongoro Crater is the world’s largest intact volcanic caldera (a collapsed ancient volcano) which forms the backdrop for a spectacular and incredibly popular safari destination. This month, we explore the crater and discover why it has been nicknamed Tanzania’s “Garden of Eden”.

Steep slopes are formed by the crater walls, which surround the hive of animal activity below; thousands upon thousands of predator and prey interact across adjoining wetlands, grasslands and woodlands. The density of wildlife makes the Ngorongoro Crater a fantastic destination for a first time safari. It’s never the same day twice in the crater also making it great for seasoned travelers returning for new, impressive safari experiences.

In addition to the epic wildlife encounters in the crater, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Southern Serengeti host the Great Migration from December to March before the million-strong herds begin the trek north. Read our guide below for updates on the migration.

Yours in Safari,
