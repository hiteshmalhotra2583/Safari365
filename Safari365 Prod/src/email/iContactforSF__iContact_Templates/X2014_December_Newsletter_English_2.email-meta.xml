A year in Africa with Safari365

As we close off another year in travel, we reflect on the moments we’ll remember and what the future holds for our incredible African continent.

There’s no doubt, African travel is coming of age. In an ever busier and more populated world, the wide expanses and simple pleasures of nature unfolding have never been more appealing. Safari365’s focus still remains squarely on safari destinations in Southern and East Africa – and we’re more excited than ever to tell you about all the changes that will make your experience to these destinations even more rewarding.

Why we&apos;re thrilled about 2015

Ebola is finally in remission thanks to incredible international support and aid. The hard working Ebola fighters even made Time Magazine’s person of the year. And rightly so. The deadly virus was no doubt the biggest threat African tourism has faced in recent years. Our #BeEbolaSmart campaign continues to be well received and we’ll continue to monitor the situation. You and your family&apos;s welfare is of our utmost interest, always.

An exlusive gift to you

Our quest to become Africa’s best travel provider continues. We are now the first and only company to offer clients a personalized photo book – a complimentary gift we offer at the end of your African holiday. It makes us proud to share your memories. It reminds us why we do what we do.

We&apos;re spreading our wings to new frontiers

Our international offices are also expanding. We’ve opened doors in Brazil, Australia and we’re the first African safari company to cater to travelers in emerging China.

New destinations

We’ve worked hard in 2014, but we didn’t forget to have some fun and visit the destinations, lodges and hotels we love. Our team were on safari for a collective total of 168 days in 2014, visiting suppliers and partners in Kruger National Park, the Garden Route, Victoria Falls, Okavango Delta, Savuti, the Serengeti and Masai Mara and notably throughout Zimbabwe – a new and exhilarating focus destination that we’re set launch in 2015.

On that note, we’re eagerly awaiting the opening of the new international airport at Victoria Falls – which could link long haul destinations and regional hubs (such as Nairobi and Cape Town) directly with this safari hotspot. Development in the surrounding safari destinations is expected to follow suit, coinciding with Zimbabwe tourism finally getting back on its feet.

#DiscoveryYourJourney in 2015

We can’t wait for 2015. We’re proud to unveil our new 2015 campaign #DiscoverYourJourney. Here’s to taking the first step of a new adventure… happy New Year, we wish you a joyous festive season.

From Africa to you,
