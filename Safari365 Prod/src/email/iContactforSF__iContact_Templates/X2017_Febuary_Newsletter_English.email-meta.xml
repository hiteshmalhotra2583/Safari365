WRAPPING UP SUMMER IN CAPE TOWN

Dear [First Name]

Cape Town is the city that everybody loves.  It has it all: the people, the culture, the food and the scenery.

The city is nestled beneath the natural wonder of Table Mountain, and incredible beaches, fine dining, and world-class wineries are within easy reach. It’s no wonder that Cape Town was voted number two on Lonely Planet’s Top Ten Cities for World Travelers to visit in 2017.

In the Southern Hemisphere, March signifies summer slowly coming to an end. But that doesn’t mean there are any less exciting events happening this month.

Cape Town is abuzz. The International Design Indaba is currently being hosted in the city’s ArtsCape Theater, and the new luxury Silo Hotel has recently opened. More notably, Cape Town is busy completing work on the Zietz Museum of Contemporary African Art, opening in September 2017. This new development in the art world is said to rival London’s Tate Modern, the MoMA in New York and the Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid.
