    <subject>Safari365: Celebrate Africa in 2015</subject>
    <textOnly>Celebrate Africa in 2015

Summer is around the corner ready to wrap its arms around us like a warm blanket. The smell is enough to make you fall in love. What could make this any better? Africa.

From the sunset-soaked beaches of Cape Town, to the placid waters of Chobe and the vast stretches of Namibia there’s a whole lot to be discovered with your significant other. Personally I can’t wait, it’s time to hang up my snuggly safari jacket and don my best sandals.

The time for sun, sand and Africa is coming… to celebrate, we’ve collected a few items of interest (find it all below). Don’t forget to browse our Travel Deals and grab a slice of summer fun for yourself.

See you in Africa.
