    <subject>Photos from Africa - September Newsletter</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
In our September newsletter we share some incredible photographs from several clients who have recently explored Southern and East Africa.
We also touch on concerns our international travellers have regarding Ebola in Africa, please see our full blog article here for more details.
Lastly, we are proud to announce that we are Africa’s first travel company to now include a complimentary photobook for every client that books with us, personalised with YOUR African travel photographs.
We look forward to welcoming you to Africa,
Safari365


Our vision: Grow a thriving, integrated African travel company, that offers life-enriching opportunities for clients and staff alike, whist supporting Africa’s sustainability and development through tourism.
