    <textOnly>Explore South Africa&apos;s Garden Route

Dear [fname],

South Africa’s Garden Route is renowned for being an incredibly scenic road trip. Lonely Planet praises its natural beauty while Conde Naste Traveler celebrates the diverse landscapes and activities.

The Garden Route officially stretches from Mossel Bay to Storm’s River. To start your journey, fly into the city of George and begin your trip along the coastal road. With the Tstitsikamma and Outeniqua Mountains on one side and the crashing waves of the Indian Ocean on the other, the Garden Route encompasses some of South Africa’s best features.  This month we explore the Garden Route&apos;s highlights.

This destination is a fantastic option for a self-drive trip. It is undeniably beautiful with safe roads that sweep through dense coastal forests and charming beachside towns, around river valleys and gorges, and alongside expansive golden sandy beaches. Towns such as Oudtshoorn, Knysna, Wilderness, and Plettenberg Bay are dotted along the way and are teeming with a variety of experiences to keep the whole family entertained.

The Garden Route ends near Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape, making a safari in one of the Eastern Cape game reserves a thrilling and easy add-on to your Garden Route trip. Fly out of Port Elizabeth and your journey along the Garden Route is complete!

If you are seeking beautiful scenery and adventure look no further; this destination offers you value for money in a region full of breathtaking views.

Yours in Safari,
