    <subject>Seasons Greetings from Safari365</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear [fname],

2017 was a good year for African travel.
International arrivals continued to grow, with the additional of key airline partners servicing direct routes to Cape Town and Kilimanjaro. Local airline routes have been advanced, notably the service linking Cape Town, Victoria Falls and Nairobi and other nodes. A number of political regime changes occurred which is bound to have a positive spinoff for stability on the continent. On the ground, Africa still offers incredible opportunities for travelers looking for new and authentic travel experiences found nowhere else in the world.
Behind the scenes at Safari365, we had the privilege of helping over 2000 travelers realize their African safari dreams in 2017. We launched our German division, allowing us to better cater for our German-speaking guests. We expanded our team of Cape Town-based consultants by training a stellar group of junior consultants. We also kick-started the year with our new media division, giving us the opportunity to produce some fantastic stories and videos showcasing Africa.
To celebrate the end of another great year, we have collected clips from our favorite destinations to create our final video for the year. Watch it below and relive some amazing moments.

Thank you to all of our guests who have travelled with us. For those who have yet to experience Africa, we hope to see you on the continent soon!

Yours in Safari,
The Safari365 Team</textOnly>
