    <textOnly>Experience Africa with Safari365 in 2019


Dear [fname],

A new year means opportunities for new and exciting experiences - especially for travel! In 2019, we believe Africa should be at the top of your travel bucket-list.


Africa is unforgettable; it is a diverse destination of discovery and wonder.  Imagine tracking the famed Big 5 across the savanna plains of the Serengeti and paddling through the winding waterways of the Okavango Delta on a mokoro, or witnessing the impressive force of Victoria Falls and enjoying the natural splendor and vibrancy of cosmopolitan Cape Town.


Thanks to the unique experiences, the abundance of natural beauty and wildlife and the variety of top accommodation options, Africa places itself firmly as a must-see destination.


Every year, the Safari365 team welcomes a multitude of guests to Africans shores. From the first contact, throughout the planning process and during your trip, Safari365 is here to make sure our travelers have the absolute best experience of this incredible continent.


Make 2019 your year to visit Africa’s top destinations! Safari365 is the team to help make your African travel dreams a reality.


Your African journey begins here.



Yours in Safari,
