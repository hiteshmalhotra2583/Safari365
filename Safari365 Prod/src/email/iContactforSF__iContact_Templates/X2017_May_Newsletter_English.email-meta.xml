Dear [fname],

“Peaceful, remote and starkly beautiful”; “At one with nature”; “Incredible wildlife and exquisite lodges” These are some of the responses received when we asked recent Safari365 clients to describe their experiences of the Okavango Delta.
The Okavango Delta attracts guests seeking staggering natural beauty as well as low-impact safari experiences. From getting up-close to elephant and hippo during a mokoro (traditional dugout-canoe) excursion through the delta’s winding waterways, to encountering animals on foot during a walking safari, to experiencing the delta from above in a hot air balloon. This month’s newsletter features this iconic attraction; see our video from a recent staff exploration trip.
As a further travel incentive, it is now easier than ever to combine the Okavango Delta and Cape Town, with direct flights linking these destinations five times a week.
Yours in Safari,
