Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

We’ve proudly launched a new African destination for you to discover, Zimbabwe! We traveled far and wide – from the expansive Lake Kariba, to the iconic Hwange National Park, to the truly wild Mana Pools – in order to bring you the best advice, experiences and African memories.

Find everything you need to know about this
awe-inspiring destination here.
