    <textOnly>Sensational South Africa

Dear [fname],

When it comes to African destinations, little tickle the senses quite like South Africa.

From the mighty Table Mountain, wide open romantic stretches of beach, the Big 5 and pulse racing adventures – it’s a world in one. Not to mention the hotels and lodges are superior.

This month we look at what makes South Africa such a great place to travel to and why you should take advantage of last minute bookings (and weakening South Africa exchange rate) – or add it to your bucket list for 2016.

We also have plenty of good news to share. See below, I’m sure it will leave you inspired.
