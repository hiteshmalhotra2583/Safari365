    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},

This is a warm welcome home after what I trust was an incredible African experience! It has been an absolute pleasure helping you throughout the planning and execution of your holiday, and I can only hope that it was everything that you had dreamed it would be.

You should have already received details on how to obtain your complimentary photo book and review your trip to Africa. If not, please proceed to your Members Club by clicking https://www.safari365.com/members/login/{!Opportunity.Members_Club_ID__c}

Also, we love being social, so join our family on Facebook, stay in touch with us on our Blog or share your thoughts and experiences with other travellers on Tripadvisor or Google+. If you discuss your trip with friends and family and they are inspired to follow in your footsteps, I would be very grateful if you would pass on my details.

Thank you again for travelling with us and I hope to welcome you back to Africa soon

Kind regards,
