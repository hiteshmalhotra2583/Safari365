    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},

I hope yourself and TRAVELLING PARTNER NAME are well and - MAKE THIS PERSONAL.

I have just recalled that it was almost a year ago today that you last travelled with us, and it jogged my memory of your trip to DESTINATION/HOTEL/LODGE.

As you know, Africa is a vast continent with so many different landscapes, attractions and things to do.  If this continent has gotten under your skin (like so many people that have travelled with us before) we would love to show you more of Southern or East Africa. We have some inspiring travel ideas, life enriching experiences and fantastic travel offerings throughout these destinations!

Stay well and I look forward to hearing from you

Kind regards,
