    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},
Greetings from sunny Cape Town.

Thank you for your online enquiry, we have noted that you do not wish to pursue your enquiry at this stage. Safari365 specialise in Southern Africa (including South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique),  East Africa (Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda) as well as the Indian Ocean Islands (Madagascar, Mauritius and Seychelles).

We tailor-make our holidays, safaris and experiences to exceed the clients expectations and deliver a holiday of a life time.  This can be tailor-made from a midrange level to a luxury level offering our clients the best rates (10-15% less than booking direct) due to our large buying power and brand.
