I run the Safari365 USA Office, based in Seattle WA, and generally touch base with clients on the initial enquiry to understand your needs and ensure you are working with our most applicable consultant. I would like to introduce you to {!Lead.OwnerFullName}, who has been working in the safari industry since {!Lead.Consultant_Working_Since__c} and comes highly recommended. {!Lead.OwnerFirstName} is based in South Africa and is aware of Africa’s best travel opportunities, and will be your point of contact when you are in Africa and actually travelling.
