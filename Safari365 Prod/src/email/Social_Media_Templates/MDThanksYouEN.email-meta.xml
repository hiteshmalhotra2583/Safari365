    <subject>Thank you from Safari365</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.FirstName},

I just wanted to write you a quick note, expressing our appreciation for you recommending XXXX for their upcoming trip to Africa. I have been working on a very special experience for them, and I think the itinerary planned will get them to have an incredible African experience.

As a thank you, we would like to send you a small gift of appreciation. Without giving the surprise away, would you prefer:

Something liquid that has been fermented?
A coffee table book featuring Africaâ€™s best photographs?
A memento that holds your travel documents for a future trip?

Please let me know, and please provide me with your full residential address ( together with any delivery instructions I should tell the courier company)

Yours in Safari,
