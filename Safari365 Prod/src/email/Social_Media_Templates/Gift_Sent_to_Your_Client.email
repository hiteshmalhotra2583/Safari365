Hi {!Opportunity.OwnerFirstName},

NB NB!! Send an email to {!Opportunity.Referring_Client_Name__c} to let them know we have sent the thank you gift to them for referring {!Opportunity.Account} to us (or call them for a catch-up and a thank you) 

This is the best for your referral database!! If you don't send an email to the client, they will not know it comes from Safari365.

Tell them that the gift we sent is {!Opportunity.Which_Gift_was_Sent__c} 
Courier Company and Tracking Number: {!Opportunity.Gift_Tracking_Order_Details__c}

Please advise your Sales Manager when you have had feedback from the client after they received the gift.
