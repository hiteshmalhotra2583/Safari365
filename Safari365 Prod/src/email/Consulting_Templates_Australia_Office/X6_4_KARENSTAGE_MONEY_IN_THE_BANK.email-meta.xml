    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.FirstName},

Greetings from sunny South Africa and I hope that this email finds you well.

As you are a previous client and have travelled with us in TRAVEL DATE, this is just a courtesy email to introduce myself (as OLD CONSULTANT MAME is no longer with the company).

Africa is a vast continent with so many different landscapes, attractions and things to do.  If this continent has gotten under your skin (like so many people that have travelled with us before) we would love to show you more of Southern or East Africa. We have some inspiring travel ideas, life enriching experiences and fantastic travel offerings throughout these destinations!

As a repeat client, we would also send you a 3-bottle case of South Africaâ€™s finest wine for re-booking with us (this offer is also valid should you refer anyone to us), and you can be sure of receiving the best rates and top class service once again.

Stay well and I look forward to hearing from you

Kind regards,
