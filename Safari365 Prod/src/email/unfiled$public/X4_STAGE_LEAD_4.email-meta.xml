    <subject>{!User.Division} - {!Lead.FirstName} {!Lead.LastName} : Your African Vacation Enquiry</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},
Thank you for your enquiry. {!User.Division} specialises in scheduled and tailor-made safaris to Southern and East Africa.

We have a wide selection of tours and accommodation available, and generally these range from USD 100 per person per night and upwards. I realise that the budget indicated on your enquiry form was lower than this; please consult the attached document for an indication of what a safari to Africa will cost as well as where you can find excellent value.

On the surface, travel to Africa may seem expensive; however, the value lies in the memories and experiences of this unique destination. If you are able to meet the budget, we would be delighted to assist you. Should it not be within your reach, please follow this link for more budget-conscious accommodation options: http://www.safarinow.com/

Kind regards,
