    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.Name},
Thank you for the feedback. I realise that in this day and age, value for money is the first and foremost consideration in any undertaking. I can appreciate that you are naturally looking to get the best value for your money.

That said, I firmly believe in the value of the product that has been offered – an African holiday is often a once-in-a-lifetime experience, the memories of which will last a lifetime. I know it is a cliche’, but I don’t believe we sell holidays; we sell experiences.

Because I believe so strongly in the value of the itinerary I have put together for you, I have spoken to the powers that be and negotiated a one-time discount for you.

If you can put a deposit down by *******, I am able to offer a ******** discount on the total cost of the itinerary.

I know that price should not be the only deciding factor, but if it helps tip the scales to what I believe is a superb itinerary, then we are happy to do so.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Kind regards,
