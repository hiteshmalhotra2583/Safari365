Travelling in Africa is like no other destination, and for this reason I tailor-make all of my clients travel arrangements from scratch. My job is to ensure you get the best possible experience on your holiday and save money by booking through Safari365.

GOOD QUESTIONS  -SHOW YOU HAVE READ THEIR COMMENTS

FEEL OUT THE PRICE QUESTION (I notice the initial rough price estimation was USD XX. Is this around the price range you were considering or should we look at more affordable or luxurious options?)
What else is important to you on his holiday? If I have missed anything, please let me know

Ideally, I would like chat to you on the phone about your request. If this is convenient for you, please advise the best time for me to call you or give me a call on {!User.Phone} or our toll-free numbers.
