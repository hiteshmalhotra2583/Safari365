    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},
I am the Team Leader for our Sales Consultants and have been monitoring the early stages of planning your safari to Africa.

As {!Lead.OwnerFirstName} has not heard from you in some time, I would like to lend my services to make sure you are getting what you need. Africa is an incredible, life-enriching destination, so it is important we understand your needs to build your perfect African experience.

If we have missed the mark or your travel plans have changed, please let me know so we can make the necessary amendments. We are keen on making your African dream a reality

I look forward to hearing from you

Kind regards,
