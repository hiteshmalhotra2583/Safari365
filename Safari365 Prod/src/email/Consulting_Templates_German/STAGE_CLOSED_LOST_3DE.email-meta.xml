    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.Name},
Thank you for the feedback.

I realise that planning the perfect vacation can be a daunting and sometimes involved process. Although we know that our clients book with us due to the superior service they receive, we also realise that it is equally important to receive maximum value on an investment of this size.

When it comes to value for money, we carefully select our suppliers to ensure you always get the most bang for your buck. As we are based on the internet we cut out the middleman to pass these discounts directly on to you. We are confident that when you compare a like-for-like itinerary our price will always come out tops.

I therefore kindly request you please send me the competing itinerary for an honest appraisal and for us to give you a comparative quote for your business.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Kind regards,
